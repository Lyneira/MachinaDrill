Compiling
---------

You'll need some knowledge of how to create a bukkit plugin with Eclipse.
If you're new to plugin writing, the Bukkit wiki has a [tutorial][] that's a
good starting point.

There's no build system included for now, so you'll need to import it as a
project into Eclipse. Add a current bukkit snapshot jar as an external library,
then right click on your project and choose Export... -> Java -> Jar File.
Make sure only the plugin.yml and src items are ticked, choose your destination
file and click Finish!
